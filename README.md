==============

A caching library for android.
It takes care of the underlying storage of the actual data, by making the cache location transparent.
The caching approach is made to be very fluid, so the users can decide how the objects are to be stored in memory.

The library is still very much in its infancy, and a lot of changes are expected to happen soon
